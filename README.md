## Introduction

Deft is a small Python package that encapsulates some functionality that I've found useful, both in my everyday development and in data science.

## Installation

To install, run the following command in a terminal (ideally one running a Python virtual environment):

    pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ deft

## Usage

To use Deft, import the package by including the following line at the top of your script or notebook:

```python
import deft
```

Or, to import specific modules (for example, the `array` module):

```python
from deft import array
```
